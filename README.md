## Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp - Week 13 Mini Project
In this challenge, I worked with Charlie Hinton to build an ETL pipeline for crowdfunding data. We transformed the data provided into 4 different CSV files and built a database in PostgreSQL. In addition, we mocked up an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using QuickDBD.

We both worked separately on the initial portion of the project (separating the data out into their own dataframes/tables), compared our work, and discussed any differences in our thought process. Once completed, we worked together over Zoom to create the ERD, exported the SQL file from QuickDBD, and made any necessary edits in PGAdmin's query tool. After confirming that we could import the CSV files into the tables without error, we were finished.
